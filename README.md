# Image-Similarity

This is a python application to compare if two images are equal or not using openCV.
It compares two colored images of equal size and same type.<br>
Firstly, load the two images using imread function and then resize them. 
<br>Calculate difference between the two images and split the RGB differences among three variables using split function.
<br>Then check if all the RGB channels difference is 0.
<br>If yes, the two images are similar.
